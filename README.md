# TalkTotal
TalkTotal is chatroom based site built with the Python Django framework reminiscent of sites like Discord. Users can create and interact with different rooms associated with different topics. If a specific discussion room catches your interest, users can leave messages inside the room. Recent activity(messages) will also display on the site in chronological order, so you can keep up with the latest messages!

# Installation Instructions



# Future Goals
1. I would like to continue building on the user model so that it's easy for users to add a custom profile pic.
2. Adding some filters to the topics, such as only displaying a list of your favorited topics on the home page.
